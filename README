## INTRODUCTION

## CodonModelTest is an R function that wraps codonPhyML (http://sourceforge.net/projects/codonphyml/ and
http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/6/1270) to provide a framework for fitting codon models to sequence
data for downstream phylogenetic inference. CodonModelTest accepts PHYLIP (format for codonPhyML) files
and converts NEXUS and FASTA (using the partner script convert.R) before running analysis. You should have
both codonmodeltest.R and convert.R in the same directory as both your sequence data and 
codonPhyML to run your analysis.

Although there are many codon models in the literature (for review, see Chapters 2 and 3 in Codon Evolution: 
Mechanisms and Models, ed. G.M. Cannarozzi and A. Schneider, 2012, Oxford University Press), CodonModelTest 
fits only those models that are implementable in phylogenetic tree search programs that handle multilocus
data regularly, and which are familiar to molecular systematists. As of this writing, the two most applicable 
softwares are MrBayes (http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/) and GARLI (https://code.google.com/p/garli/). 
CodonModelTest writes appropriate NEXUS blocks and control files for these two programs automatically 
during analysis. Blocks for mrbayes are written to take advantage of the BEAGLE library for speeding up
analysis using GPU computation.

CodonModelTest accepts files of any genetic code, and corrects for the different numbers of free parameters
during model selection.

Model selection in codonmodeltest is accomplished using any of the three major information criteria: AIC,
AICc, and BIC. Likelihood ratio tests are not currently implemented. Furthermore, selection of best-fit
reversible matrix submodels (e.g. abccba, in PAUP* notation) is not supported. 

CodonModelTest fits models onto a single distance-based tree topology. For all genetic codes except
mitochondrial, CodonModelTest uses the Kosiol et al. (2007) model for distances. For mitochondrial data
codonmodeltest uses a Jukes-Cantor (1969) calculation. Search intensity per model has been set such that 
most analyses should finish in an hour or two. Codonmodeltest currently runs 5 BFGS passes per model. The
default is 10, but so far I have not noticed much of a difference in scores.

Models tested in codonmodeltest are variants of the Goldman-Yang (1994) parameterization and the Muse-Gaut
(1994) parameterization. Only GY models are implemented in phylogenetic search programs due to the similarity
of their calculations with 4x4 nucleotide models. MG models are included as an option for comparison purposes
only.

For GY models, codonmodeltest fits M0, M3, and M5 variants, with F1xCODON, F1x4, and F3x4 frequencies. For M0,
codonmodeltest also fits an M0+Gamma model. This model often provides very good fit for some data, especially 
for fishes. I have found M5 to also provide good fit to many datasets, but it is not implemented in multilocus
phylogeny programs. To approximate M5, an M3+Gamma model can be used, although be wary of the number of parameters
and increased computational time and memory resources.

I welcome input on improving and extending the code. Please cite the repository in any publications that use
codonmodeltest.



## VERSION HISTORY

## 0.22:  Fixed rates typos. Made mrbayes model block output more specific.

## 0.20:  Added some coarser heuristics for LL search. Uses 5 rounds of BFGS, instead of default
##		  10 rounds.

## 0.18:  Fixed problem with identifying nsites (probably a \s PHYLIP dimensions issue).

## 0.17:  Added companion function for sequence file conversion from NEXUS and FASTA to sequential
##        PHYLIP. Also fixed a few bugs.

## 0.16:  Corrected model selection to eliminate Gamma[2] to reflect that Gamma[N] has a fixed number
##        of parameters, regardless of N.

## 0.155: fixed error in reporting ic.table that did not print output if a single model had weight 1.0.
##	      also fixed associated error for assigning nst in MrBayes block when ic.table was length 1.

## 0.15: fixed error with results folder specification if multiple copies of script in same folder.
##       Fixed intermittent issue with path specification in Windows.

## 0.10: initial version.
